# Javascript, Javascript , why you so pretty ?

### This is my story of how i met javascript and fell in love with it. It is my greatest achievement so far.

It took me 3 years to realize why i love you, javascript so much.

I started coding back in 2010. when i met 'HTML' , 'CSS' and yeah the queen, 'Javascript'.
At first it was just basic designing and at that time I didn't realize how much important javascript 
would be later in my life.

I haven't heard of node.js at the time and after watching 'the social network' , i thought PHP was the one 
i was waiting for my entire life. I started learning PHP to write server side code and also developed a 
website for one startup, to get a feel of what can be achieved with it. Honestly, I wanted to make a great website 
like facebook and i may have been wrong at that point of time as instead of finding my own dreams i started 
following mark zuckerburg for what he has achieved as if it could be re-invented.

But oh boy, i must have known at that point that real success cannot be re-invented . A person has 
to carve his own path for a fulfilling life. 

So, PHP was good but there were more amazing ones waiting for me on my journey. Then i met python .Man! Python 
was neat. Code indentaion lead to pure readable code. Learning 
python was good but I actually believed in writing code for the web so i went on to learn Django. 
I had a difficult time back then. I tried my best to get along with django but maybe we were not 
made for each other. 

After all this commotion. I didn't stop. Something was attracting me all this time. It was always 
present with me yet i didn't notice. It was javascript. It never left me all this time. One day 
i was sitting alone with javascript sharing my broken feelings with her about not able  
to find the one. Javascript was always like my client side scripting language and i never considered it as 
an option. Until that day, When javascript introduced me to its hidden talent of handling server requests 
using node.js. 

It was an eye opener. I finally found what i had been waiting for. My patience finally paid off. Node.js is this
most beautiful and elegant framework ever. I fell for it the day i saw it and it has been 3 years and since we 
have this amazing connection where we just click as if its made for me. My love for it cannot be expressed 
in words. Its just overbrimming love that couldn't be just expressed. 

Javascript , i love you. 
Because of you , i am able to write real time code so peacefully. 
You are new to all this stardom i know. But i will always be there for you 
and i know you can make through good and bad times as i would always be standing right 
next to you.

Next I met meteor.js and it made writing full stack web applications a breeze. It was haeaven on earth.
But i wanted to get in control of my application more so i started developing applications 
using angular.js, express.js, socket.io. to write beautiful elegant code.

Every piece of code that i write comes from the deepest part of my heart where resides my love 
for javascript.

Javascript, I just want you to know . You were always there when i needed you and i am always there 
for you.
