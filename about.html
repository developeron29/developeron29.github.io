#About me 
<p style="width: 70%;">
	Hi there fellow human,
<br><br>
	I am ( Ayush || Ash ), just a curious human being. I am the type of human being, who doesn't like to put up any labels 
	on himself. I could say i study this, I work at this, I am good at that. But, maybe, that would just feel a little bit empty. Because those things are just a part of me, just few of the ways i have learned to express myself. But, that's not the best way to experience the infiniteness of who i really am. You can take me to coffee some day, trying to get to know me better. But, what you really be trying to do would be just to see how much alike and how much different i am to you. Nobody knows, who we are and what we are here to do. We just say few words, express ourselves, and form an 'identity' of ourselves based on how people react to what and how we have to offer. For example: Maybe from when you're young, you started to wear a certain colour or started smiling a certain way, because everybody around you said( verbally or non-verbally ) that that's what they like about you. Then maybe, your life's purpose is you just want to be loved and accepted by others. But, then, the person you are today isn't actually who you really are. But, the sum of different ways as when and how you felt 'accepted'. I'll let you in a little secret, The day when everybody would start to find themselves from within themselves rather than how people see them, they would experience the vast infinity that each person belongs to. Yep, now that really introduces me, I am part of the great awakening, I am the great awakening. I am here because you wanted me to here. I am here because of you, and i am here to assist you, to see the real & actual world, as it is and to discover who you really are. <br><br>

I love to do some random projects or hack into new libraries(preferably javascript and python).<br/>
I love machines and want to grow older with them.<br/>
I love to create something out of nothing and i want to make the world a better place to live<br/>
I know one day planet earth will get so peaceful and blissful that people don't need to die to go to heaven<br/>
I am also a strong believer of having inner peace and happiness as its ultimately the only goal <br/>
I also love robots and will love to have one as a friend one day.<br/>
